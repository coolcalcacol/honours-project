\subsection{Abstract/Core Focus}\label{subsec:abstract/core-focus}
This thesis investigates and compares a robotics simulation suite based on the Unity3D game engine integrated with ROS (ROS-Unity3D) against the established ROS-Gazebo simulation suite.
The comparison focuses on their architecture, the process of environment creation, resource utilisation, and simulation accuracy, particularly for an autonomous mobile ground robot.
The core finding is that ROS-Unity3D presents a viable alternative to ROS-Gazebo.
It demonstrates better scalability for larger environments, offers superior shadow quality, and is more adept at real-time LiDAR simulation.
Conversely, ROS-Gazebo provides a more streamlined interface with ROS, boasts a wider array of existing sensor plugins, and is more efficient in terms of computational resources when simulating smaller environments.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Weaknesses/Limitations of the Research}\label{subsec:weaknesses/limitations-of-the-research}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Software Version Dependency:} The findings are tied to the specific versions of ROS, Unity3D, and Gazebo used at the time of the research (2022).
    Given the rapid development in these platforms, some detailed aspects might have changed.
    \item \textbf{Specificity of Test Cases:} The comparison uses a specific Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) (Jackal UGV) and particular test environments (e.g., HRATC, Agriculture, Lunar Surface).
    The results might not directly extrapolate to all types of robots or scenarios, such as the high-speed dynamics and specific sensor configurations of a Formula Student AI car.
    \item \textbf{Focus on General Comparison:} While comprehensive, the thesis aims for a general comparison rather than providing a prescriptive guide for optimising or selecting a simulator for a highly niche application like Formula Student AI, which may have unique requirements not fully covered (e.g., very specific aerodynamic effects or tire models if needed).
    \item \textbf{Sensor Plugin Availability:} Notes ROS-Gazebo has more existing sensor plugins, which could be a limitation for ROS-Unity3D if custom sensor development is extensive and time-consuming for a project.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Relevance to Honours Project: "Investigating the use of Genetic Algorithms to optimise a path planning algorithm within the Context of a Formula Student Team"}\label{subsec:relevance-to-honours-project:-"investigating-the-use-of-genetic-algorithms-to-optimise-a-path-planning-algorithm-within-the-context-of-a-formula-student-team"}

Platt's (2022) thesis is highly relevant to my honours project, especially for the key deliverable of creating ``A simulation environment''.
The insights from this paper directly inform the choices and development process for this simulator, as mapped to my project's Input-Process-Output (IPO) model:

\subsubsection{Input Relevance}
My project's \textbf{input} phase for the simulation environment involves selecting appropriate technologies and understanding their capabilities.
Platt's work provides:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Technology Evaluation:} A thorough comparative analysis of ROS-Unity3D and ROS-Gazebo, which are primary candidates for a ROS-based simulation environment compatible with ROS2 (as per my project's requirements).
    \item \textbf{Feature Assessment:} Details on critical features such as physics engine performance (important for simulating vehicle dynamics), sensor simulation capabilities (LiDAR, cameras are crucial for SLAM), graphical fidelity (for realistic testing), and resource usage.
    This helps in weighing trade-offs, e.g., Unity's graphical fidelity vs.
    Gazebo's ROS integration maturity.
    \item \textbf{Model Compatibility:} Information on compatibility with standard robot description formats like URDF, which is essential for importing or creating the Formula Student car model.
    \item \textbf{Scalability Considerations:} Insights into how each platform scales with environment size and complexity, relevant for creating varied and realistic test tracks for the Formula Student car.
\end{itemize}
This allows for an informed decision on the foundational software for the simulation environment, directly impacting the quality and suitability of the inputs to the SLAM, path planning, and genetic algorithms.

\subsubsection{Process Relevance}
The \textbf{process} of my project includes ``Research into simulation environments'' and ``Developing a simulation environment''.
Platt's thesis contributes significantly by:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Foundational Research:} Serving as a key academic reference for understanding the state-of-the-art in ROS-compatible simulators for mobile robots.
    \item \textbf{Design Guidance:} The detailed comparison of architectures, coordinate systems, time synchronisation, and physics engines (e.g., Unity's PhysX vs.
    Gazebo's options) informs the design choices during the development of my custom simulation environment or the customisation of an existing one.
    \item \textbf{ROS Integration Insights:} Explaining the mechanisms for connecting the simulator to ROS (e.g., ROS for Unity, Gazebo's native plugins) is vital for ensuring seamless data flow for sensor data, control commands, and SLAM/navigation outputs.
    \item \textbf{Benchmarking Ideas:} The methodology Platt uses for comparing resource utilisation, simulation speed, and accuracy (localisation error, mapping accuracy) can inspire the benchmarking and validation processes for my own simulation environment to ensure it meets the project's needs for testing path planning and GA optimisation.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Output Relevance}
One of the main \textbf{outputs} of my project is ``A simulation environment''.
Platt's work helps ensure this output is robust, well-justified, and fit for purpose:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Justification of Choice:} The findings can be used to justify the selection of a particular simulation platform (e.g., choosing Unity for better graphics and LiDAR if those are prioritised, or Gazebo for its ROS ecosystem maturity and resource efficiency in simpler scenarios).
    \item \textbf{Defining Scope and Features:} Understanding the capabilities and limitations of existing tools helps define the scope and essential features of the custom simulation environment tailored for Formula Student AI challenges (e.g., accurate cone detection, track representation).
    \item \textbf{Contribution to Report:} The analysis from Platt's thesis can be referenced in the project report, specifically in the section detailing the development and rationale behind the simulation environment, demonstrating a research-informed approach.
    \item \textbf{Context for Algorithm Testing:} A well-chosen/developed simulator, informed by such comparative studies, provides a reliable platform for testing the SLAM algorithm, the path planning algorithm, and the genetic algorithm's effectiveness in optimising lap times, which are other critical outputs of my project.
\end{itemize}
In summary, Platt's thesis provides a valuable, in-depth analysis that directly supports the research, development, and justification of the simulation environment component of my honours project, ensuring it aligns with current best practices and technological capabilities in robotic simulation.
