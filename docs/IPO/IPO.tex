    \section*{Title of Project:}
    Investigating the use of Genetic Algorithms to optimise a path planning algorithm within the Context of a Formula Student Team

    \section*{Overview of Project Content and Milestones:}
    The project will involve the development of a simple Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (SLAM) algorithm\cite{LeLargeBiederLauer2021} used to store and refine the locations of cones that conform to the current FSUK-AI 2025 rules\cite{FSUKAIRules2025}, relative to a global reference frame based on the car's starting position.
    Then, using the output of the developed SLAM algorithm, we will investigate the use of genetic algorithms to optimise a path planning algorithm\cite{HarperEvolutionary}\('\)s output to facilitate the fastest possible lap time.
    In addition, we will also develop a simulation environment\cite{platt2022comparative} to test the performance of the SLAM algorithm, path planning algorithms and genetic algorithm implementations.
